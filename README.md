Tanzania
========

Work for a project in collaboration with PhD students.

This folder contains:

A csv formatted array of monthly precipitation values (mm) recorded at 11 stations over the coastal region of Tanzania. (This file is also online at my personal website, and it is that location from which the iPython notebook will look for the data.)

An iPython Notebook, which contains the workflow to process the csv data. Much of the heavy-lifting is done in Pandas. 

Several pub-quality pdf figures saved as output from the Notebook.

I this repo and its contents are citable with a doi provided by Figshare.
