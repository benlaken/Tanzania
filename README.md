Tanzanian Precipitation and Vegitation Analysis
=================================================

Work for a project in collaboration with PhD students.

This folder contains:

A csv formatted array of monthly precipitation values (mm) recorded at 11 stations over the coastal region of Tanzania. (This file is also online at my personal website, and it is that location from which the iPython notebook will look for the data.)

Two iPython Notebooks, which contain the workflow to process the csv data. Much of the heavy-lifting is done in Pandas. The first notebook relates to an
analysis of precipitation data from ranfall gauges. The second relates to a
correlation analysis of the precipitation data in concjunction with MODIS 
Enchanced Vegitation Index (EVI) data, which I prepared earlier from Google's
Earth Engine.

Several pub-quality pdf figures saved as output from the Notebooks.
